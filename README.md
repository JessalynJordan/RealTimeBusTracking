# Real Bus Tracker

Real Bus Tracker is a simple web application that visualizes the movement of a bus marker along predefined bus stops on a map using Google Maps API.

## Description

This application demonstrates the movement of a bus marker along a predefined route represented by a series of bus stops. The bus marker moves from one stop to another in a loop, simulating the movement of a real bus. Each time the bus marker reaches a stop, its color changes randomly.

## Features

* Displays a map with a bus marker moving along predefined bus stops.
* The bus marker changes color randomly each time it reaches a stop.

## Usage

To use Real Bus Tracker:

1. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
2. The map will be displayed, and you will see a bus marker moving along the predefined route of bus stops.

## Dependencies

* Google Maps API: Used for displaying the map and handling geographic data.
* 'styles.css': Contains custom CSS styles for the application's layout and appearance.

## Code Structure
* 'index.html': HTML file containing the structure of the webpage, including the map container and script tags.
* 'styles.css': CSS file containing custom styles for the application's layout and appearance.
* Inline JavaScript: Defines the bus stops, initializes the map, creates and moves the bus marker, and handles color changes.

## Future Improvements

* ### User Interaction: #### Add user interaction features, such as the ability to click on bus stops to see additional information or to pause/resume the bus movement.
* ### Customizable Routes: #### Allow users to define and visualize custom bus routes on the map.
* ### Real-Time Data: #### Integrate real-time data from a transportation API to display accurate bus locations and arrival times.
* ### Responsive Design: #### Improve the responsiveness of the application to ensure it works well on various screen sizes and devices.
* ### Accessibility: #### Enhance accessibility features to ensure the application is usable by all users, including those with disabilities.
